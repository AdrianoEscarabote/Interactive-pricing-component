## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- Parcel 

### Continued development

I really liked the efficiency and simplicity of parcel, about styled-components despite having read a little about organization, I'm still having doubts about the best ways to organize the files! I thought it was really cool to develop this project with react, despite being a small and simple project, it was perfect to practice a little with new tools.
